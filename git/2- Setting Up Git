After you are satisfied with your Git version, you should configure Git so that the generated commit messages 
you make will contain your correct information and support you as you build your software project.

Configuration can be achieved by using the git config command. Specifically, we need to provide our name and email address
because Git embeds this information into each commit we do. We can go ahead and add this information by typing:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"

We can display all of the configuration items that have been set by typing:

git config --list
Output
user.name=Your Name
user.email=youremail@domain.com
...
The information you enter is stored in your Git configuration file, which you can optionally edit by hand with a text editor
of your choice like this (we’ll use nano):

nano ~/.gitconfig
~/.gitconfig contents
[user]
  name = Your Name
  email = youremail@domain.com
Press CTRL and X, then Y then ENTER to exit the text editor.

There are many other options that you can set, but these are the two essential ones needed. If you skip this step,
you’ll likely see warnings when you commit to Git. This makes more work for you because you will then have to revise the commits you have done with the corrected information.
